# Requirement
To run SymTuner, you only need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com) on your system.

Because we provide a [docker](https://www.docker.com) image that all requirements are pre-installed at [skkusal/symtuner](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/skkusal/symtuner). 

## The experiment setting 
We conducted all experiments on a Linux machine equipped with 
two Intel Xeon Gold 6230R and 256GB RAM, where it has a total of 52 cores. Therefore, when running SymTuner by using your own machine, it may differ from the experimental results on our paper. We recommand to run SymTuner with a Linux machine having 16GB RAM and 4 cores.
