We are applying for the three badges: Available, Functional, Reusable badges. We believe that our artifact is worthy of the badges for the three reasons:
* The DOI link is as: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5909070. The artifact is available on the public repository: https://github.com/skkusal/symtuner
* We provided all the benchmarks used in the evaluation and useful script for reproducing the main experimental results of the paper.
* We also provided the devcontainer settings with all requirements pre-installed. So we believe that other researchers are able to reuse and improve our tool easily in their own research.
